# About Loop Loop Break

It is I, Nathan, one of those web peeps. On this here blog type contraption I write about programming, web design and computery stuff.
(Okay there are only {{ collections.post | size }} posts so far, but let's dream big).

You can check out<sup>1</sup> some of my code at [github.com/nathanwale](https://github.com/nathanwale).

I've been a web designer, developer, and an IT teacher. But my real dream is to pilot a giant robot to first place in the tri-state regional break dancing competition. I don't care if they say it's against the rules â€” the Supreme Court will decide<sup>2</sup>.
