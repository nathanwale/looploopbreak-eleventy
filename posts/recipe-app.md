## Summary
This was an app I created as part of my iOS App Development Certificate at RMIT.

One of the requirements was to use a remote JSON API, so I chose the one at <a href="https://www.themealdb.com/">themealdb.com</a>. Unfortunately the recipes 
there are a bit hit and miss, and not really usable for a professional app.

The app is fully story-boarded and uses Swift's in-built JSON decoding.

## Design
There were multiple iterations to the design phase. 

The [design document](/pdfs/DEV104%20Design%20docs%20and%20wireframes%20-%20Nathan%20Wale.pdf) includes wire-frames, a persona, and a vision statement.

There was also a paper-prototyping session. You can [read the analysis of that](/pdfs/DEV104%20Paper%20prototyping%20analysis%20-%20Nathan%20Wale.pdf).
